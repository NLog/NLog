NLog is a free logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management
capabilities. It makes it easy to produce and manage high-quality logs for
your application regardless of its size or complexity.

It can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET language, augment
them with contextual information, format them according to your preference
and send them to one or more targets such as file or database.

Major and minor releases will be posted on [project news](https://nlog-project.org/archives/). For smaller updates, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NLogOfficial)

 ℹ️ Looking for NLog 5? Just install NLog 4.5+! 

NLog 4.5 implements the platforms added in NLog 5 (.NET Standard 1, .NET Standard 2, UWP, etc) and added structural logging, *without breaking changes*!


NLog Packages
---
NLog consists of multiple packages. Most of the functionality is inside the NLog (core) package. What's inside the packages? See [targets](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Targets) and [layout renderers](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Layout-Renderers) overview!

See Nuget/build status of all official packages [here](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/blob/dev/packages-and-status.md)


Questions, bug reports or feature requests?

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
---
See [FAQ on the Wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/faq)


Contributing
---
As the current NLog team is a small team, we cannot fix every bug or implement every feature on our own. So contributions are really appreciated!

If you like to start with a small task, then
[up-for-grabs](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aup-for-grabs+-label%3A%22almost+ready%22+)  are nice to start with.

Please note, we have a `dev` and `master` branch

- `master` is for pure bug fixes and targets NLog 4.x
- `dev` targets NLog 5


A good way to get started (flow)


1. Fork the NLog repos.
1. Create a new branch in you current repos from the 'dev' branch. (critical bugfixes from 'master')
1. 'Check out' the code with Git or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. Check [contributing.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#sync-projects)
1. Push commits and create a Pull Request (PR) to NLog

Please note: bugfixes should target the **master** branch, others the **dev** branch (NLog 5)
