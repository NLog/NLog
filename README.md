NLog is a free logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management 
capabilities. It makes it easy to produce and manage high-quality logs for 
your application regardless of its size or complexity. 

It can process diagnostic messages emitted from any .NET language, augment 
them with contextual information, format them according to your preference 
and send them to one or more targets such as file or database. 

For more information, see the website [nlog-project.org](http://nlog-project.org)
or just get started with the tutorials on [the NLog wiki](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki).
