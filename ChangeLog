2006-08-24 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* Added infrastructure to create your own logger types inheriting from
	Logger: 

		LogManager.GetLogger(string name, Type type) and 
		LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger(Type type)
		LogFactory.GetLogger(string name, Type type) and 
		LogFactory.GetCurrentClassLogger(Type type)

	* Added ${event-context} layout renderer that extracts information from
	LogEventInfo.Context
	* Added eventID and categoryID parameters to EventLog targets.
	* Added LogManager<LoggerType> that manages logger instances of LoggerType
	where LoggerType : Logger
	* Added missing code documentation 
	* Fixed Network target to work properly with IPV6
	* Added example ${rot13} layout renderer - that demonstrates how 
	wrapper layout renderers can be written.
	* Added support for DEFAULT nested layout parameters. You can now write:

	${file-contents:${basedir}/file.txt}
	${rot13:URYYB}

2006-08-03 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* MANY CHANGES TO CLEAN UP APIs AND ENSURE EXTENSIBILITY - MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO STABILIZE AGAIN

	* Added ${file-contents} layout renderer which inserts file contents.
	* Added [DefaultParameter] attribute which allows for nameless parameters
	to layout renderers:

	${aspnet-application}
	${aspnet-request}
	${aspnet-session}
	${date}
	${environment}
	${file-contents}
	${gdc}
	${mdc}
	${process-info}
	${special-folder}
	${asp-application}
	${asp-request}
	${asp-session}

	* Added ILayoutWithHeaderAndFooter.cs for layouts that support
	header/footer (such as CSV Layout, more to come)
	* The following targets have been enhanced to support headers/footers:

	Console
	ColoredConsole
	Debugger

	* Added NLogConfigurationException which is thrown instead of CLR
	exceptions when the configuration fails 
	* Simplified XmlLoggingConfiguration by splitting large methods and moving
	common functionality to PropertyHelper
	* Added Layouts/LayoutWithHeaderAndFooter.cs and
	TargetWithLayoutHeaderAndFooter.cs
	* Added MailTarget.AddNewLines to insert new lines between
	header/lines/footer
	* Added PopulateLayouts() method to ILayout
	* BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the default value of
	FileTarget.OpenFileCacheTimeout to -1
	* Added support for nested layout renderers. Used in ${file-contents}

	${file-contents:fileName=${basedir}/aaa.txt}

	This required a large rewrite of the parsing engine. Hopefully the test cases
	cover all possible situations.
	* Removed LogEventInfo.Empty and replaced with
	LogEventInfo.CreateNullEvent()
	* Added CsvLayout.WithHeader which can be used to disable CSV header.
	* Added VJSharp and Web item templates. Updated the installer to support
	VWD Express 2005.
	* Enhanced XSD Schema generation by properly generating abstract and
	layout properties.
	* Some more unit tests.

2006-07-31 Maarten Claes <m.claes@farcourier.com>
	* Changed RichTextBox Target to be thread safe. Uses delegate to log
	to RichTextBox
	* Same changes made to FormControl Target

2006-07-22 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* Fixed NLogViewer and Chainsaw targets
	* New NLog.Benchmark that uses code generation and compilation to
	create more "clean" environment.
	* Added ${gc} which can be used to get the GC statistics (very limited)
	* Added ${processinfo} which can be used to extract the performance
	information about the current process (possibly others in the future as
	well)
	* Added ${gc} which can be used to get the GC statistics (very limited)
	* Added Initialize() and Close() to the LayoutRender class
	* Added optimized CurrentTimeGetter which is way faster than DateTime.Now
	* Some small optimizations

2006-07-18 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* Added ImpersonatingWrapper which temporarily changes the credentials
	for the duration of the write.
	* Moved the implementation of LogManager to a reusable LogFactory while
	maintaining its public interface. You can now easily have a private
	LogManager for an assembly.

2006-07-17 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* Synchronized Visual Studio solutions to source code directories. Now
	part of the build process.

	* Added proper camelCasing to the web build process
	* Fix for multiple email addresses being passed in To,CC and BCC fields
	under .NET 2.0 (reported by Pawel Parzychowski)

2006-07-07 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Added NLog.ILayout which Layout implements to 
	allow other	layout types (such as CSV-escaped, HTML-colored, 
	XML-escaped, ANSI-colored) to be implemented
	NLog.Layout became sealed.
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Added NLog.TargetWithLayout, removed Layout
	and CompiledLayout from NLog.Target
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Removed CSVFile target, converted examples to File + CsvLayout
	* Added pluggable layouts (CSV, Log4JXml), LayoutFactory and
	LayoutAttribute. The syntax is:

	<target xsi:type="File">
		<layout xsi:type="CSVLayout">
			<column name="message" layout="${message}" />
			<column name="level" layout="${level}" />
		</layout>
	</target>

	Of course the old syntax is still supported for simple layouts:

	<target xsi:type="File" layout="${message}" />
	* BREAKING CHANGE - FileTarget.KeepFileOpen is back to the default
	of false. Thankfully we now have <default-target-parameters /> so this 
	can be easily overriden.

2006-07-05 Maciej Figatowski <mfigatow@sav.net>
	* Added FilterResult.IgnoreFinal and FilterResult.LogFinal
	which suppress processing of further rules if the filter
	matches.

	specifies default values for all targets in the section

2006-06-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* implemented <targets><default-wrapper /> </targets> that wraps all
	targets in <targets> section with the specified wrapper.

2006-06-23 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>
	* fixed some race conditions in the Network target
	* added NetworkTarget.Close()

2006-05-20 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added support for VC#Express and VBExpress to the installer.
	* Added VS2005 C# and VB.NET code snippet (nlogger) to quickly
	insert logger creation statement
	* Added VS2005 item templates for NLog configuration. Updated the
	installer.
	* Removed some stupid Console.Write()
	* Updated MailTarget.SmtpAuthentication to be SmtpAuthenticationMode instead

2006-05-10 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* (hopefully) Fixed OpenFileCacheTimeout taking too much CPU

2006-05-05 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Completely rebuilt the installer.
	* Reworked the way documentation is generated. We now use NDoc 2.0 Alpha
	3k and there are still some minor issues.

	* Added LayoutRenderer.IsAppDomainFixed() and an optimization to turn
	such things into literals.
	* Added LoggingConfiguration.GetConfiguredNamedTargets() API
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Completely restructured the way File target works.
	The new structure is based on Streams instead of StreamWriters and
	enables archiving (kind of similar to "rolling file appender" from log4net
	world, but supporting multiple files at a time)
	* BREAKING CHANGE - removed some properties which accepted strings. Now
	replaced with enums.
	* Added caching to File target to optimize the number file open/close
	operations
	* Added an option for multiple processes to append to the same OPEN file
	in a synchronized manner. Unixes get this   for free, but Win32 requires
	you to use mutexes to synchronize file access.
	* Enabled the use of enumerations as parameteters (including docgen)
	* Added InternalLogger.LogToConsoleError and their config file and
	environment variable counterparts
	* Refactored website generation

2006-03-19 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Optimization to defer calling String.Format() until it's really
	needed.

2006-02-24 Rafal Gwizdala <gwrafal@poczta.onet.pl>

	time the message is passed to it.
	* Added FSNormalize option to ${identity} target to strip all
	characters not allowed in the file names and replace them with
	underscores.

2006-02-24 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added config-level option <targets async="true">...</targets>
	to automatically wrap all targets with AsyncWrapper

	* Updated assembly version and description for 0.95 release.

2006-02-13 Yuri Mamrukov <yvm@att.net>

	did the logging itself.

2005-10-26 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ${aspnet-sessionid} to access (guess!) ASP.NET session ID

2005-10-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ASPNetBufferingWrapper target which buffers and post-processes
	the entire ASP.NET request (requires you to use the NLogHttpModule)
	* Added PostFilteringWrapper target which is able to filter log events
	based on a buffer as a whole. It is possible for example to dump the
	detailed ( >= Trace level) trace of a request if there was at least 
	one >= Warn event in the buffer, but under normal conditions only output
	the >= Info levels.
	* Reworked the way the documentation is generated (we no longer use
	ugly IFRAMEs and the same method is used to generate the website and
	the docs)
	* Added a new conditions language (see conditions.html for more
	information) which let you write powerful   filtering conditions 
	while keeping the syntax natural and readable
	* Added <when condition="..." action="..." /> filter which uses condition
	expressions
	* Added examples for the MailTarget and BufferedMailTarget
	* Fixed Close() behaviour for unnamed targets (like the ones configured
	by SimpleConfigurator)
	* Added some more documentation (still some work to do before the release)

	* Added ${processname}, ${processid} layout renderers
	* Added GDC (Global Diagnostics Context) and ${gdc} layout renderer which
	is a global (as opposed to per-thread) version of MDC and ${mdc}

2005-10-11 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Fixed a nullref exception when no config file was present.
	* Fixed support for CC field in the Mail target
