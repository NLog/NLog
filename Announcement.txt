NLog 0.95 has been released!

NLog is a .NET logging library designed with simplicity and flexibility 
in mind. With NLog you can process diagnostic messages emitted from 
any .NET language, augment them with contextual information, format 
them according to your preference and send them to one or more targets.

The API (application programming interface) is similar to log4net, 
and the configuration is very simple. NLog uses a routing table 
while log4net uses a logger hierarchy with attachable appenders. 
This makes NLog's configuration very easy to read and maintain. 
The new release includes major architectural changes, 
new features, speed improvements and bug fixes.

Major changes: 

* Added new Trace level, more verbose than the Debug level.
* Added a new conditions language which lets you write powerful filtering conditions while keeping the syntax natural and readable
* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed Target.Append() method to Target.Write()
* Added Target.Write(LogEvent[] manyEvents) for cases where the target can optimize group writes
* Added global log threshold and configurability at the config level (<nlog globalThreshold="..." />)
* Added support for <variable name="" value="" /> configuration element. Details are here.
* Added infrastructure for compound targets and wrapper targets.
* Added detailed documentation with examples for many targets, both on the website and in the help file

Bugs fixed: 

* Fixed the filter configuration bug as reported by Ron Grabowski
* Fixed a serious reentrancy bug which caused all sorts of problems when formatted message included a parameter where ToString did the logging itself. More details here. 
* Fixed a nullref exception when no config file was present.
* Fixed support for CC field in the Mail target
* Fixed Close() behaviour for unnamed targets (like the ones configured by SimpleConfigurator)
* Typos in the code prevented Chainsaw target from working properly.
* ${callsite} not working with database parameters
* ${callsite} doesn't work with MethodCall target and NLogViewer target
* Connection string builder omits ; after Server parameter
* Fixed the Trace target in Release mode by defining TRACE symbol
* Fixed VS.NET Compact Framework project file
* Fixed the Trace target in Release mode by defining TRACE symbol
* Fixed bugs related to ${asp-request:cookie} and ${aspnet-request:cookie}
* Fixes for case-insensitive parsing of the config files.
* fixed CompactFramework build

New additions: 

* Added <when condition="..." action="..." /> filter which uses condition expressions
* Added ${aspnet-sessionid} to access (guess!) ASP.NET session ID
* Added ${processname}, ${processid} layout renderers
* Added ASPNetBufferingWrapper target which buffers and post-processes the entire ASP.NET request (requires you to use the NLogHttpModule)
* Added PostFilteringWrapper target which is able to filter log events based on a buffer as a whole. Details are here.
* Added GDC (Global Diagnostics Context) and ${gdc} layout renderer which is a global (as opposed to per-thread) version of MDC and ${mdc}
* Added authentication options to the Mail target (thanks Ron).
* Added support for caching layout results per logEvent which makes them transportable across threads
* Added ${log4jxmlevent} which renders log4j-compatible XML event
* Added wrapper targets: AsyncWrapper, AutoFlushWrapper, BufferingWrapper, RepeatingWrapper, RetryingWrapper
* Added compound targets (fallback, randomize, roundrobin, split)
* Added ${windows-identity} layout renderer.
* Added MSMQ target (Message Queue)
* Added EventLog target
* Added ${pc} - Performance Counter layout renderer
* Added SimpleConfigurator.ConfigureForTargetLogging() and SimpleConfigurator.ConfigureForFileLogging()
* Added Debugger target
* Added ${logger:shortname=true} option.
* Added ${stacktrace} layout renderer, 3 different logging formats. Details are here.
* Added ${newline} layout renderer.
* Added IgnoreCase option to filters

Other changes: 

* Project web site has been moved to http://www.nlog-project.org/
* Patch by Yuri Mamrukov to simplify InternalLogger configuration from environment variables and/or App.config settings. Fixes some nasty bug there. More details are available here.
* Excluded NLogViewer from build and project. It will become be a separate project here.
* Added batch NLogC compilation, added installer and nlogc binary snapshot.
* Added some minimal VB.NET test code
* Added some meaningful error message when a named target is not defined.
* Added many unit tests
