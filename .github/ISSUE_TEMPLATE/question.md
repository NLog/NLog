Hi!

If you have a question that the logging isn't working, check the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/nlog/nlog/wiki/Logging-troubleshooting) first before posting.
Almost every case is solveble with the internal log

Are you searching for a layout or layout renderer? You could find them [here](https://nlog-project.org/config/)

StackOverflow.com is recommended for questions. You could expect a faster response there (but do include all the info below) and the search is better.

Important details when asking question on StackOverflow.com:

- Use the tag "nlog"
- Include versions of NLog/NLog.AspNetCore etc.
- Include the platform (.NET 4.5, ASP.NET Core 3, Xamarin etc)
- Include the current config (xml or code)
- Explain current result
- Explain desired result
- Please post full exception details (message, stacktrace, inner exceptions) in case of an error
