  The bibliography feature looks for <cite>name</cite> elements in XML documentation
  and <ddue:cite>name</ddue:cite> elements in MAML and automatically generates links
  to a bibliography section, which is generated at the bottom of each topic.

  To use this feature in MAML you must also add the <ddue:bibliography/> element
  somewhere in your topics; preferably, right before the <ddue:relatedTopics> section.

  This file is used to describe the entries in the bibliographies for every topic
  that is generated.  For example, add a remarks section such as the following to
  the XMl documentation comments in one of your APIs.

  <remarks>
    <para>
      Sandcastle is a popular download<cite>sandcastle activity</cite>.
    </para>
    <para>
      I expect Sandcastle's popularity<cite>sandcastle activity</cite> to increase
      as more community members become aware of its usefulness.
    </para>
  </remarks>

  Then add the following reference element along with any others to this file to
  describe those citations.

  <reference name="sandcastle activity">
    <title>Sandcastle Help File Builder Activity Statistics</title>
    <author>Eric Woodruff</author>
    <publisher>GitHub.com</publisher>
    <link>https://GitHub.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/pulse/monthly</link>
  </reference>

  Building documentation now will produce your auto-generated reference topic with a
  bibliography section near the bottom.  Each <cite>name</cite> is replaced in-line
  with a hyperlink such as [1], [2], [3], [n]..., linking to the corresponding
  entries in the bibliography section.

  - The title element is required.
  - The author element is required.
  - The publisher element is optional.
  - The link element is optional.
  - Reference names are case-sensitive.
  - If a matching reference is not found, the cite element is processed as regular
    markup.  Currently, the transformations will remove the outer <cite> element but 
    inner text and content may pass through to the topic.
