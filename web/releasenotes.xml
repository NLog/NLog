                <p><b>NLog 1.0 Release Candidate 1 is available!</b></p>
                <p>
                    After 2 years of work, we're proud to announce the availability of NLog 1.0 Release Candidate 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Packaging changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separate compilation of NLog for all supported frameworks. Starting with NLog v1.0 there will be releases
                        for each supported platform (currently 7!), both debug and release.
                    </li>
                    <li>Merged NLog.Win32.dll, NLog.DotNet.dll, NLog.Unix.dll and NLog.Mono.dll into one assembly NLog.dll</li>
                    <li>Added generation of NLog.xsd schema for Visual Studio Intellisense.</li>
                    <li>Prepared ready-to-run example projects for VS2005 that describe most targets.</li>
                    <li>Compilation, schema generation a and website building are supported on Linux/Mono. All unit tests pass.</li>
                    <li>Added support for VC#Express and VBExpress to the installer.</li>
                    <li>Added VS2005 C# and VB.NET code snippet (nlogger) to quickly insert logger creation statement</li>
                    <li>Added VS2005 item templates for NLog configuration. NLog now looks for "NLog.config" in addition to other config file names.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   Changes to the logging infrastructure:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>BREAKING CHANGE - Completely restructured the way File target works.
                        The new structure is based on Streams instead of StreamWriters and enables 
                        archiving (kind of similar to "rolling file appender" from log4net world, 
                        but supporting multiple files at a time!). It also speeds up things a lot.</li>
                    <li>Refactored file watching - should speed up non-logging by 100%</li>
                    <li>BREAKING CHANGE - removed some properties which accepted strings. Replaced with enums for type safety.</li>
                    <li>
                        Added attributes which mark support for particular runtimes and OSes. 
                        They are used for generating documentation and disabling particular targets/layout renderers at runtime.
                    </li>
                    <li>Optimization to defer calling String.Format() until it's really needed.</li>
                    <li>Added LayoutRenderer.IsAppDomainFixed() and an optimization to turn such 
                        things into literals. So if you use "${basedir}/log.txt" this gets converted 
                        into a literal which takes no time to recalculate.</li>
                    <li>Added LoggingConfiguration.GetConfiguredNamedTargets() API</li>
                    <li>Added Layout.Escape() which escapes ${ with ${literal:text=${}</li>
                    <li>Added Logger.Log(LogEventInfo) overload</li>
                    <li>Added Logger.Log(Type,LogEventInfo) overload - useful for wrapping NLog.Logger</li>
                    <li>Added LoggerReconfiguredDelegate and Logger.LoggerReconfigured events</li>
                    <li>
                        Added InternalLogger.LogToConsoleError and their config file and 
                        environment variable counterparts to send log output to Console.Error.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added support for flags-type enumerations.</li>
                    <li>Added &lt;include file="..." ignoreErrors="true|false" /&gt;</li>
                    <li>Fixed autoReload to keep monitoring the file if the reloaded file has an error</li>
                    <li>Added <x><default-wrapper /></x> that wraps all targets in <x><targets /></x> section with the specified wrapper. The usage is:
                        <code lang="XML">
                            <![CDATA[
                            <targets>
                                <default-wrapper type="AsyncWrapper" />
                                <target name="f" type="File" />
                                <target name="n" type="Network" />
                            </targets>
                            ]]>
                        </code>

                        This creates "f" which is actually a AsyncWrapper(File) and "n" which is 
                        AsyncWrapper(Network). Note that the original target names are renamed as 
                        "f_wrapped" and "n_wrapped" respectively.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   New additions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented AsyncWrapper for .NET CF using the Timer class</li>
                    <li>Added WebService target supporting SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2, HTTP GET and HTTP POST web service calls.</li>
                    <li>Added CSVFile target which does proper CSV (comma-separated values) formatting (multi-line and 
                        special character quoting). This enables you to analyze your log files in MS 
                        Excel.</li>
                    <li>Added caching to File target to optimize the number file open/close operations.</li>
                    <li>
                        Added an option for multiple processes to append to the same OPEN file in a synchronized manner. 
                        Unixes get this for free, but Win32 requires you to use mutexes to synchronize file access. 
                        This gives a nice performance boost.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added deleteOldFileOnStartup to the File target</li>
                    <li>Added replaceFileContentsOnEachWrite to the File target</li>
                    <li>Added FileTarget.LineEnding</li>
                </ul>

                        did the logging itself. More details <a href="http://trac.nlog-project.org/nlog/ticket/64">here</a>.

                        as a whole. Details are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8806711&amp;forum_id=41984">here</a>.</li>

                <p><b>NLog 0.9 has been released!</b></p>

                <p>Major changes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>API redesign/rename.</b></li>
                    <p>"Appender" has been renamed as "Target" and 
                        "LayoutAppender" as "LayoutRenderer". This should make it easier for 
                        people to understand the basic concepts ("layout appender" wasn't a good 
                        idea). Old configuration file format is still supported. Old extension code 
                        should require nothing more than a search/replace and a recompile.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Improved logging and non-logging speed by removing most abstraction
                        from the Logger class.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        A single non-logging operation takes only 7 
                        nanoseconds which means 140.000.000 logs/second). Logging API should remain 
                        the same.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Changed the way the configuration file is parsed. Now elements are 
                        processed top-down and you can change the order of the sections as well as 
                        the elements you reference have been processed before. 
                    </li>
                </ol> 

                <p>Bugs fixed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fixed an old bug where appenders were incorrectly combined into a chain.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>New additions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Network target (capable of sending messages over TCP and UDP, HTTP to be 
                        supported)</li>
                    <li>Preliminary NLogViewer target and a sketchy, but already usable viewer 
                        application. "Chainsaw" target should probably be added as well.</li>
                    <li>Added LogManager.GlobalThreshold</li>
                    <li>API documentation, target, layout renderer and filter documentation is 
                        generated from source code comments using NDoc.</li>
                    <li>100% of public methods are commented in the source code.</li>
                    <li>Reworked the tutorial and howtos</li>
                    <li>Reworked the website.</li>
