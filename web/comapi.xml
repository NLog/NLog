    <h1>COM API</h1>
    <p>
        NLog features a COM Interop API tha can be used to provide logging for legacy COM applications/components that
        are deployed as part of a .NET solution. COM support is available with 2 coclasses with ProgIDs: <code>NLog.LogManager</code>
        which lets you perform basic configuration and <code>NLog.Logger</code> which does the actual logging.
    </p>
    <p>
        COM components are supported for many languages, both scripting and compiled. Basic usage is
        similar to the .NET API, with the following exceptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instances of loggers are created directly, you don't need to use LogManager to get them.</li>
        <li>Because COM classes don't support passing parameters at construction time, you need to set
            each logger's name by setting its <code>LoggerName</code></li>
        <li>Passing of format arguments isn't supported</li>
        <li>Logger levels (arguments to the <code>Log()</code> method) are passed as strings instead of enumeration values - this provides maximum compatibility
            with scripting environments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following example demonstrates the use of NLog COM api for JScript.
