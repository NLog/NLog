Issue labeling
====

When a new issue is submitted at GitHub, it will be labeled. 

We use the following guideline:

* preferably, each issue has a label, although this isn't a goal. The goals is to get a nice overview where we stand & if there a lot of issues.
* Bug-reports, even non-confirmed bugs are labels under `bug`.
* Functional changes are labeled under 'feature'. Even small `features`.
* Non-functional changes  are labeled under `enhancement`.
* Issue's that have missing info are labeled under `incomplete info`. If we don't get a response within 14 days, I will **close** the issue.
* answered questions are **closed** after 3 days. 
* Issues which have PR's are labeled under `almost ready`
* The rest of the labels should be straightforward ;)
