NLog


What is it? 
-----------
NLog is a .NET Logging Tool designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind.
In many concepts it is similar to log4net (http://logging.apache.org/log4net).
  
Why NLog?
---------
Because I always found log4net too difficult to configure and maintain
and too Java-ish to use. NLog is more .NET-ish as far as usage and 
extensibility are concerned. NLog uses the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, 
stupid) principle wherever possible.
