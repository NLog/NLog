2006-05-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Implemented AsyncWrapper for .NET CF using the Timer class
	* Refactored file watching - should speed up non-logging by 100%

2006-05-20 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added support for VC#Express and VBExpress to the installer.
	* Added VS2005 C# and VB.NET code snippet (nlogger) to quickly
	insert logger creation statement
	* Added VS2005 item templates for NLog configuration. Updated the
	installer.
	* Removed some stupid Console.Write()
	* Updated MailTarget.SmtpAuthentication to be SmtpAuthenticationMode instead 
	of a string.
	

2006-05-15 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Fixed File target causing delay at exit.
	* Added generation of NLog.xsd schema for Intellisense.

2006-05-15 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Reverted to NDoc 1.3.1 running under CLR 2.0 for docgen.

2006-05-10 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* (hopefully) Fixed OpenFileCacheTimeout taking too much CPU

2006-05-05 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Completely rebuilt the installer.
	* Reworked the way documentation is generated. We now use NDoc 2.0 Alpha
	3k and there are still some minor issues.
	* Separate compilation of NLog for all supported frameworks
	* Cleaned up the code, now compiles with warnaserror="true"
	
2006-04-22 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Merged NLog.Win32.dll, NLog.DotNet.dll, NLog.Unix.dll and NLog.Mono.dll
	into one assembly NLog.dll
	* Added attributes which mark support for particular runtimes and OSes

2006-04-18 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added LayoutRenderer.IsAppDomainFixed() and an optimization to turn
	such things into literals.
	* Added LoggingConfiguration.GetConfiguredNamedTargets() API
	* BREAKING CHANGE - Completely restructured the way File target works.
	The new structure is based on Streams instead of StreamWriters and
	enables archiving (kind of similar to "rolling file appender" from log4net
	world, but supporting multiple files at a time)
	* BREAKING CHANGE - removed some properties which accepted strings. Now
	replaced with enums.
	* Added caching to File target to optimize the number file open/close
	operations
	* Added an option for multiple processes to append to the same OPEN file
	in a synchronized manner. Unixes get this   for free, but Win32 requires
	you to use mutexes to synchronize file access.
	* Enabled the use of enumerations as parameteters (including docgen)
	* Added InternalLogger.LogToConsoleError and their config file and
	environment variable counterparts
	* Refactored website generation

2006-03-27 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

    * Updated .NET CF project file

2006-03-21 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	to LoggingRule.LoggerNamePattern. 
	Thanks to danieljaysmith - at - excite - dot - com for spotting this.

2006-03-19 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Optimization to defer calling String.Format() until it's really
	needed.

2006-02-24 Rafal Gwizdala <gwrafal@poczta.onet.pl>

	* Add PerfCounter target that increases the PC value by one each
	time the message is passed to it.
	* Added FSNormalize option to ${identity} target to strip all
	characters not allowed in the file names and replace them with
	underscores.

2006-02-24 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added config-level option <targets async="true">...</targets>
	to automatically wrap all targets with AsyncWrapper

	* Updated assembly version and description for 0.95 release.

2006-02-13 Yuri Mamrukov <yvm@att.net>

	* Patch to simplify InternalLogger configuration from environment
	variables and/or App.config settings. Fixes some nasty bug here.

2006-01-13 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	when formatted message included a parameter where ToString
	did the logging itself.

2005-10-26 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ${aspnet-sessionid} to access (guess!) ASP.NET session ID

2005-10-25 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ASPNetBufferingWrapper target which buffers and post-processes
	the entire ASP.NET request (requires you to use the NLogHttpModule)
	* Added PostFilteringWrapper target which is able to filter log events
	based on a buffer as a whole. It is possible for example to dump the
	detailed ( >= Trace level) trace of a request if there was at least 
	one >= Warn event in the buffer, but under normal conditions only output
	the >= Info levels.
	* Reworked the way the documentation is generated (we no longer use
	ugly IFRAMEs and the same method is used to generate the website and
	the docs)
	* Added a new conditions language (see conditions.html for more
	information) which let you write powerful   filtering conditions 
	while keeping the syntax natural and readable
	* Added <when condition="..." action="..." /> filter which uses condition
	expressions
	* Added examples for the MailTarget and BufferedMailTarget
	* Fixed Close() behaviour for unnamed targets (like the ones configured
	by SimpleConfigurator)
	* Added some more documentation (still some work to do before the release)
	* Fixed the example for asynchronous Tile target (async="true" is not 
	supported and is replaced by the AsyncWrapper target)

2005-10-21 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Added ${processname}, ${processid} layout renderers
	* Added GDC (Global Diagnostics Context) and ${gdc} layout renderer which
	is a global (as opposed to per-thread) version of MDC and ${mdc}

2005-10-11 Jaroslaw Kowalski <jaak@jkowalski.net>

	* Fixed a nullref exception when no config file was present.
	* Fixed support for CC field in the Mail target

	snapshot.

	* Refactored NLogViewer by separating NLogViewer.Interfaces
	* Added NLogViewer.NDumbsterSmtpReceiver (by Ron Grabowski)
	* Added support for caching layout results per logEvent which
	makes them transportable across threads
	* Renamed Target.Append() method to Write() (how did I forget it?)
	* Added Target.Write(LogEvent[] manyEvents) for cases where the
	target can optimize group writes
	* Added Log4JXmlEvent.cs
	* Added Wrappers: AsyncWrapper, AutoFlushWrapper, BufferingWrapper, 
	RepeatingWrapper, RetryingWrapper
	* Some preliminary work on request buffering wrappers. 
	* Added compound targets (fallback, randomize, roundrobin, split)
    * WARNING: This requires some serious testing.
